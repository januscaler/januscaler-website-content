    <div class="text-4xl font-semibold mb-6">Why WebRTC Matters</div>
    <p class="text-lg text-gray-700">
    WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) has revolutionized the way we connect, communicate, and collaborate online. It enables real-time audio, video, and data sharing directly in web browsers, eliminating the need for cumbersome plugins or third-party software. However, the complex and often monopolistic landscape of WebRTC providers has made it challenging for developers to fully embrace this technology.
